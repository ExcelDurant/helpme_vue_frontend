# helpme-vue

## Overview

This is a project which deals with connecting people who need tasks to be done with helpers(task doers). In this platform, users will be able to create tasks(for example house chores, technician work, repairs, etc) which can be completed in less than a day, and will attach the amount he is willing to pay upon completion of the task. Helpers(users/freelancers) will be able to view tasks and find the ones they are able to do
